# pycellga: A Python Package for Improved Cellular Genetic Algorithms

`pycellga` is a Python package that implements cellular genetic algorithms (CGAs) for optimizing complex problems. CGAs combine the principles of cellular automata and traditional genetic algorithms, utilizing a spatially structured population organized in a grid-like topology. This structure allows each individual to interact only with its neighboring individuals, promoting diversity and maintaining a balance between exploration and exploitation during the optimization process. `pycellga` has machine coded operators with byte implementations. Beside it has Alpha-male CGA, Machine Coded Compact CGA and Improved CGA with Machine Coded Operaors for real-valued optimization problems.

## Features

- **Cellular Genetic Algorithms (CGAs)**: Efficient implementation of CGAs with various built-in functions.
- **Machine-Coded Operators**: Includes byte-based and machine-coded operators for efficient numerical data handling.
- **Customizable**: Various customization options to suit different optimization problems.
- **Alpha-male CGA**: A specialized CGA variant.
- **Machine Coded Compact CGA**: Optimized for compact representations.
- **Improved CGA with Machine Coded Operators**: Enhanced performance for real-valued optimization problems.
