"""
    The Ackley function is a commonly used benchmark function for optimization algorithms, especially 
    in continuous problem domains. It is characterized by its complex landscape, including many local 
    minima and a global minimum at the origin. The function is used to test the performance of optimization 
    algorithms due to its challenging, multi-modal nature and its ability to assess the balance between 
    exploration and exploitation strategies. The Ackley function features a large, flat outer region with 
    a steep drop-off to a narrow, deep central hole, making it a valuable test for algorithm robustness 
    and convergence behavior.
